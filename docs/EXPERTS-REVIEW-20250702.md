4. **Manual Deployment**: No automation or infrastructure as code

#### Recommendations
1. Add Docker support and Kubernetes manifests
2. Implement Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards
3. Create operational runbooks and troubleshooting guides
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline with automated deployments
