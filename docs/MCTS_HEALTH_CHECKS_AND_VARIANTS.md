# MCTS Health Checks and Algorithm Variants

## Summary

Based on extensive research and analysis, I've enhanced the MCTS health verification script with 13 comprehensive checks that detect common MCTS implementation issues. Our system currently uses **UCB1 (Upper Confidence Bound 1)** algorithm with an exploration weight of 1.4.

## Current MCTS Implementation

### Algorithm: UCB1 (Upper Confidence Bounds applied to Trees)
- **Selection Strategy**: `ucb1` 
- **Exploration Weight**: 1.4 (configurable)
- **Formula**: `average_reward + exploration_weight * sqrt(ln(parent_visits) / child_visits)`
- **Database Strategy Field**: Currently shows "default" but only UCB1 is implemented

## New Health Checks Added

### 1. **Exploration-Exploitation Balance**
- Detects over-exploitation (exploring too few nodes)
- Monitors visit concentration (too many visits to single nodes)
- Checks visit variance for premature convergence
- **Common Issue**: Poor tuning of exploration constant leads to suboptimal performance

### 2. **UCB1 Score Sanity**
- Validates UCB1 calculations are within expected ranges
- Detects negative scores (implementation error)
- Checks for infinite scores (unvisited nodes)
- Monitors for unusually high scores
- **Common Issue**: Incorrect UCB1 formula implementation mixing up parent/child visits

### 3. **Tree Balance**
- Detects overly deep trees (>50 levels - inefficient)
- Identifies overly wide trees (>100 nodes per level - memory issues)
- Checks for degenerate trees (linear chains)
- Monitors branching factor
- **Common Issue**: Poor tree management leading to memory or performance problems

### 4. **Trap State Detection**
- Identifies nodes that look good initially but lead to worse outcomes
- Compares parent scores with average child scores
- **Common Issue**: MCTS may not "see" subtle losing lines due to selective expansion

### 5. **Value Propagation**
- Verifies proper backpropagation of values up the tree
- Checks visit count consistency between parents and children
- Validates score propagation logic
- **Common Issue**: Incorrect win/loss counting during backpropagation

### 6. **Memory Usage Patterns**
- Monitors memory growth for potential leaks
- Tracks maximum memory usage
- Counts total nodes in tree
- **Common Issue**: Unbounded tree growth leading to memory exhaustion

## MCTS Variants (Potential Future Implementations)

### 1. **Thompson Sampling**
- Already in config schema but not implemented
- Probabilistic selection based on Beta distributions
- Better for problems with high uncertainty

### 2. **UCB-V (UCB with Variance)**
- Accounts for variance in rewards
- Formula includes variance term: `sqrt(2 * ln(t) * V / n)`
- Better for high-variance evaluations

### 3. **UCB-Tuned**
- Enhanced UCB1 that considers variance
- More robust than standard UCB1
- Prevents over-exploration of high-variance arms

### 4. **RAVE (Rapid Action Value Estimation)**
- Uses all-moves-as-first heuristic
- Faster convergence in deep trees
- Particularly effective for games

### 5. **Progressive Widening**
- Gradually increases branching factor
- Better handles large action spaces
- Formula: `k * n^alpha` where n is visit count

### 6. **PUCT (Predictor + UCT)**
- Used in AlphaGo/AlphaZero
- Incorporates neural network predictions
- Biases exploration based on prior knowledge

## Detected Issues in Current Implementation

From the health check on session `33f1c175`:

1. **Feature Accumulation Bug** ❌ - Already documented in Point A
2. **No Infinite UCB1 Scores** ❌ - Indicates potential expansion issues
3. **Tree Too Deep** ⚠️ - 99 levels is excessive
4. **Low Visit Variance** ⚠️ - Possible premature convergence
5. **Value Propagation Errors** ❌ - Visit counts not properly propagated

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes
1. Fix the feature accumulation bug (Point A)
2. Investigate why no unvisited nodes are being explored (UCB1 infinite scores)
3. Fix value propagation logic for visit counts

### Algorithm Improvements
1. Implement adaptive exploration weight tuning
2. Consider UCB-V for better variance handling
3. Add progressive widening for large feature spaces
4. Implement Thompson sampling as alternative strategy

### Configuration Tuning
1. Reduce `max_tree_depth` from current excessive depths
2. Tune `exploration_weight` based on dataset characteristics
3. Implement early stopping when convergence detected

## Usage

Run comprehensive health check:
```bash
python scripts/verify_mcts_health.py              # Latest session
python scripts/verify_mcts_health.py session_123  # Specific session
python scripts/verify_mcts_health.py --details    # With detailed tables
```

The script will identify issues across 13 different health dimensions and provide actionable feedback for improving MCTS performance.
